# Multidimensional approximation with thin plate regularization

The method was originally developed for multidimensional approximations of current velocity fields around open ocean installations. It was tested on numerous Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) measurements and demonstraited robust performance. More information on mathematical formulation of the method can be found in the paper (section 2.3):
